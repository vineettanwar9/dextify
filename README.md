# Problem Statement: 
An OCR system that can be used for digitalizing the clinical notes given by doctors to enable more efficient research in the field of Clinical-NLP using Machine learning and Data Analysis.

# Description: 
Healthcare and clinical patient data has always been a major resource in the medical research and analytics field all over the world. But the biggest obstacle in the utilization of these resources here in India is the fact that most of the data generated by Indian healthcare services and institutes is in the form of unstructured and non-digital records which is not directly compatible with the modern automated analytics tools such as Machine Learning and Data Analysis. In order to bridge the gap between the available data repositories and the research domain a automated system that will digitize the handwritten health records of patients and effectively store them in a digital data warehouse is proposed.
